This workload executes the RIFT pipeline -- an algorithm to perform Rapid parameter
Inference on gravitational wave sources via Iterative Fitting.
The source code of the pipeline can be found at https://git.ligo.org/rapidpe-rift/rift.
It is released under the MIT license, as documented in the
LICENSE.md file at the above repository.

The likelihood evaluations per second is used as the reported 'wl-scores'.
Detailed statistics are reported in 'wl-stats' and contain the
mean, median, maximum, minimum, and total number of copies run.
